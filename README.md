# CDS-WEB-APP

CDS-WEB-APP is currently at version 0.1, with version 2 in the process. Version 2 will be based on the evaluation results and acceptability testing based on an AI-enabled evaluation framework.  

An evaluation study for the CDS-WEB-APP has already been completed, and the results will be published shortly in a prestigious journal.

CDS-WEB-APP Goal 

The goal the CDS-WEB-APP is to develop a CDS WEB-APP, and it is supervised by Dr. Demisew, Dr. Girum, Prof. Frank Verbeke, Prof. Jan Cornelis, and Prof. Bart Jansen. The CDS WEB-APP intends to function as a plugin for existing electronic medical records or HMIS applications in order to offer CP (clinical work flow generation) and evidence-practice divide. It was developed using clinical guidelines, a card-sheet, a referral log-sheet, and point-of-care charts. Focus primarily on the primary health context in low-resource settings.

Publications 

The CDS WEB-APP outcomes have already been published and presented in Medinfo'21, MobiHealth'21, JHIDC, PLOS ONE, INDABA'18, and md4sg'19.

Key features 

1. Automated CDS WEB-APP for low resource settings

2. Hybrid algorithm (combining knowledge base with data-driven approaches) 

3. Dynamically valide and map knowledge based result using local context or hisotrical evidence 

4. Data-driven model was produced using Bayesian learning.

5. Deliver multi-criteria decisin analysis (concordance table)

6. Deployed and operated on a low-cost device such as the Raspberry Pi 4, with access via smartphone, laptop, or tablet over mobile data (or wireless network)


To install the CDS WEB-APP

pip install CDS-WEB-APP (will be released soon)
