1. Automated CDS WEB-APP for low resource settings

2. Hybrid algorithm (combining knowledge base with data-driven approaches) 

3. Dynamically valide and map knowledge based result using local context or hisotrical evidence 

4. Data-driven model was produced using Bayesian learning.

5. Deliver multi-criteria decisin analysis (concordance table)

6. Deployed and operated on a low-cost device such as the Raspberry Pi 4, with access via smartphone, laptop, or tablet over mobile data (or wireless network)
